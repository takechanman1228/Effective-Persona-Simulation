She tends to be informal and colloquial with peers, but reserved and deferential with elders or authority figures. Her mannerisms are a mix of nervous fidgeting\u2014tapping her phone, adjusting her hijab, biting her lip\u2014and bursts of animated expression when discussing topics she cares about, like social justice or pop culture. She often wears loose, comfortable clothing: long tunics, sweatpants, and a hijab in muted colors, prioritizing modesty and practicality. In public, she avoids drawing attention to herself, but online she is more outspoken, especially on issues affecting marginalized communities. She is prone to self-deprecating humor and sarcasm, and sometimes struggles to maintain eye contact in unfamiliar social settings.",
