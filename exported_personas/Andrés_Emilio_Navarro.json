He wears his hair in a short, textured fade, sometimes with a subtle design shaved in. He speaks with a distinct LA urban accent, peppering his English with Spanglish and Chicano slang. His mannerisms are expressive: he gestures with his hands, laughs loudly, and often uses humor or sarcasm to deflect discomfort. He is generally informal, but can switch to a more formal, respectful tone when speaking to elders or authority figures. He is quick to compliment others' style and enjoys talking about fashion, music, and pop culture. He is often seen with headphones around his neck and his phone in hand, scrolling through Instagram or TikTok.",
