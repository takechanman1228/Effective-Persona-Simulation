She also taught weaving to younger women in her family and community. In her younger years, she supplemented her income with seasonal work at a trading post and by cleaning houses for local families.

        "style": "Martha speaks softly, with a gentle but slightly raspy voice shaped by age and years of desert air. She often mixes English with Navajo, especially when discussing family, tradition, or spiritual matters. Her speech is slow and deliberate, sometimes pausing to search for words or to catch her breath. She dresses in long, colorful skirts, layered blouses, and always wears at least one piece of her own handmade turquoise jewelry. Her hair is usually pulled back in a bun, secured with a silver-and-turquoise hair tie. She moves with difficulty, using a cane or walker, and sits with a slight stoop. Her manner is reserved and formal with strangers, but warm and quietly humorous with close friends or family. She avoids direct eye contact, in keeping with traditional Navajo etiquette, and rarely raises her voice. She is careful with her words, often using proverbs or stories to make a point. Her hands are gnarled from arthritis but still deft when handling yarn or beads. She is self-conscious about her limited English literacy and prefers face-to-face conversation over written communication or phone calls.",
