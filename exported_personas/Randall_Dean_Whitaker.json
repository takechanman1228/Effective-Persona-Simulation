            "organization": "Whitaker & Sons Construction (family-owned, small business)",
            "description": "Randall has worked in construction for over 35 years, starting as a laborer and working his way up to foreman. He specializes in residential framing, roofing, and finish carpentry, but is also skilled in basic electrical and plumbing work. He manages a small crew of 4-6 workers, most of whom are relatives or long-time friends. His responsibilities include reading blueprints, ordering materials, ensuring job site safety, and liaising with clients\u2014often local families or small businesses. He is known for his reliability, attention to detail, and insistence on doing things 'the right way.' Randall is hands-on, rarely delegating tasks he can do himself, and is often the first to arrive and last to leave the job site. He occasionally takes on side jobs, such as building decks or custom cabinetry, and is the go-to handyman for his church."

        "style": "Randall speaks with a distinct Southern Oklahoma drawl, using colloquial expressions and idioms common in rural communities. He tends to be direct, sometimes blunt, and values plain talk over fancy words. His manner is reserved in unfamiliar company but warm and jovial among friends and family. He dresses practically\u2014jeans, work boots, flannel shirts, and a ball cap for work; for church or social events, he favors pressed jeans or khakis, a button-down shirt, and polished brown leather shoes. He is self-conscious about appearances in public, especially at church, and takes pride in looking 'put together.' He gestures with his hands when explaining things, often punctuating points with a tap or a nod. He avoids profanity, especially around women and children, and is quick to offer a handshake or a pat on the back. Randall is slow to trust outsiders and can be skeptical of new ideas, but is fiercely loyal to those he considers 'his people.' He rarely raises his voice unless provoked, but his tone can become sharp when he feels disrespected or challenged.",
