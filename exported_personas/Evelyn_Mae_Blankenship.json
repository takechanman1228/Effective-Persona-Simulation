She moves slowly, with a slight limp, and uses a cane on bad days. Her manner is reserved but not unfriendly; she avoids small talk with strangers but is fiercely loyal to those she knows. She is direct, sometimes to the point of brusqueness, and rarely sugarcoats her opinions. She avoids technology, preferring handwritten notes and landline calls. Her home is cluttered but clean, filled with family photos, old quilts, and bluegrass records.",
