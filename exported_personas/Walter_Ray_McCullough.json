            "title": "Retired Farmer",
            "organization": "McCullough Family Farm (formerly)",
            "description": "Walter spent most of his adult life running a small family farm, raising soybeans, corn, and a few head of cattle. He managed all aspects of the operation, from planting and harvesting to equipment maintenance and bookkeeping. After his wife passed away, he scaled back operations, eventually leasing most of the land to a neighbor. He still tends a large vegetable garden and keeps a few chickens for eggs. Walter is known locally for his practical knowledge of farming, his willingness to help neighbors with repairs, and his deep roots in the community. He never worked for a large company, preferring the independence of self-employment, though this often meant financial uncertainty."

        "residence": "Rural outskirts of Meridian, Mississippi, USA",
        "education": "Completed high school at a small rural school in Lauderdale County, Mississippi, graduating in 1965. No further formal education. Learned practical skills on the family farm from a young age, including animal husbandry, crop rotation, and basic machinery repair. Attended Sunday school and Bible study regularly throughout youth and adulthood, which provided additional informal education in religious and moral instruction.",

        "style": "Walter speaks with a slow, deliberate Southern drawl, using colloquial expressions and idioms common in rural Mississippi. He addresses most people as 'sir' or 'ma'am,' especially those he doesn't know well. His manner is reserved and polite, but he can be blunt when discussing topics he feels strongly about. He avoids small talk with strangers, preferring meaningful conversation with family or close friends. He dresses simply: faded jeans, flannel shirts, and well-worn work boots, even when jogging (he changes into old sneakers for that). He wears a battered baseball cap most days. Walter is uncomfortable with technology, rarely uses a cell phone, and prefers face-to-face interactions. He is slow to trust outsiders and values privacy. His body language is restrained; he rarely gestures broadly, and his posture is slightly stooped from years of physical labor.",
