        "style": "James speaks with a gentle, measured Southern drawl, his voice softened by age and a lifetime of church choir singing. He is reserved in large groups, preferring quiet conversation with one or two people at a time. His manner is polite, deferential, and marked by old-fashioned courtesy\u2014'yes, ma'am,' 'no, sir,' and frequent use of 'please' and 'thank you.' He dresses simply, favoring comfortable athletic wear or loose-fitting slacks and button-down shirts, often topped with a well-worn Braves cap. In public, he moves slowly and deliberately, using a cane on bad days, but stands tall with a quiet dignity. He avoids slang and rarely raises his voice, but his words carry weight when he chooses to speak. He is deeply respectful of elders and authority figures, and his faith is evident in his speech, with frequent references to scripture or gospel music. He is not quick to share personal struggles, but will open up to those he trusts, often using humor or storytelling to deflect attention from his pain.",
