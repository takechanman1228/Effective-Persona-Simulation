0,C,"Option C balances cushioning and support with a classic look, making it suitable for both running and everyday activities. Versatility is important because I run almost every day and spend a lot of time on my feet volunteering or running errands. I need enough cushioning to protect my knees, but I don't want something too bulky or heavy. A quality upper with good details means it will last longer and feel comfortable even after a long day. Option A is great for speed but might lack support for longer runs or standing for hours. Option B is the most protective, but I prefer something lighter and more flexible. So, Option C fits my needs best.",Serious Runner,Ayaan Warsame Mohamed
